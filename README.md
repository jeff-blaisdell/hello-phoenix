## Prerequisites
1. [Vagrant] to localize all infrastructure dependencies into a virtual machine.
2. [Ansible] to automate infrastructure installation.
2. [Elixir] because it is fun to play.

##To start your new Phoenix application:
1. Start up vagrant vm with `vagrant up local`
2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.
